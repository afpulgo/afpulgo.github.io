    <h2>Professional Dancer</h2>
    <p>As a dancer, you'll use movement, gesture and body language to portray a character, story, 
    situation or abstract concept to an audience, usually to the accompaniment of music. 
    This typically involves interpreting the work of a choreographer, although it may sometimes require improvisation.
